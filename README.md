## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Improved code readability and maintainability by following best practices.
Applied the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to avoid redundant code.
Effectively used event handling to manage user interactions.
Implemented solid logic for calculating and updating tip amounts.
Enhanced error handling to ensure robust and user-friendly input validation.
Utilized default values to handle edge cases and prevent unexpected errors.

```js
function calculate(tipValue) {
  const userBill = parseFloat(inputUserBillAmount.value) || 0;
  const numberOfPeople = parseInt(inputNumberOfPeople.value) || 0;

  if (userBill > 0 && numberOfPeople > 0) {
    const tip = tipValue / 100;
    const totalTip = userBill * tip;
    const totalBill = userBill + totalTip;
    const perPersonTip = totalTip / numberOfPeople;
    const perPersonTotal = totalBill / numberOfPeople;

    splitTipAmount.textContent = perPersonTip.toFixed(2);
    splitTotalAmount.textContent = perPersonTotal.toFixed(2);
    resetButton.disabled = false;
    resetButton.classList.add("active");
    errorMessage.style.display = "none";
    inputNumberOfPeople.classList.remove("error-border");
    inputUserBillAmount.classList.remove("error-border");
  } else {
    inputNumberOfPeople.classList.add("error-border");
    inputUserBillAmount.classList.add("error-border");
    errorMessage.style.display = "block";
  }
}
```
